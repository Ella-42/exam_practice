#42

This repository is all about preparing myself for the exams of 42.

Take note that the subjects I found is what I believe to be on the exams as of practicing for those exams, they will change at some point and I might now even have correct information.
For example: the practicing and potentially even the subject for get_next_line can be completely ignored since other students have tried this very simple version and failed with it.
